## Description:
Introduction
ArcelorMittal is a leading steel and mining company, with a presence in 60 countries and a workforce of over 190,000 people. We are committed to making steel more sustainable, safer and smarter, and to creating value for our stakeholders and society.
Within the ArcelorMittal Belgium IT department, numerous exciting IT projects are developed. They cover a wide range of business processes and make use of modern technologies (.NET Core, Angular, native Android apps, Hololens, etc.). Next to building the applications themselves, more and more attention is being paid to reporting and setting up a data architecture adapted for this purpose.
We are looking for an data/reporting analyst to support our efforts in the field of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) reporting. ESG describes how companies measure and communicate their performance on environmental, social and governance issues, such as climate change, human rights, diversity and ethics. It is becoming increasingly important, to demonstrate our progress towards our 2030 sustainability goals for a more sustainable and responsible steel industry, and to meet the expectations of our customers, investors, regulators and society at large.
With this vacancy, we are first and foremost looking for a profile that can strengthen our IT department in terms of data analysis, data architecture and reporting (with a primary focus on ESG).
What does the job entail?
To strengthen our current teams, we are looking for a candidate who is able to independently analyze and develop business questions related to reporting. The candidate must be able to capture the business questions, set up an appropriate data model (on SQL server) and finally deliver the requested reporting in our PowerBI environment.
You will join a team of application developers with whom you will work closely to develop a wide range of reporting assignments. On the one hand, we expect you to have the necessary communication skills to be able to work both independently and in a team, but on the other hand, you also have sufficient technical knowledge in the field of data architecture and PowerBI reporting. 
Within ArcelorMittal we believe in a strong collaboration between IT and business. In particular for this role, close contact with the sustainability and corporate responsibility teams will be required. Additionally, aligning the ESG reporting strategy with the global vision will enable us to meet the expectations of our customers, investors, and regulators.
Ideally, you have previous experience with application development and you will be able to complete functional and/or technical analysis assignments as we have some internal .NET programming related to data collection too. However, this is not an absolute requirement.
In other words, we offer a very varied job in which you can take on additional responsibilities step by step and you help to further develop our future IT architecture. You will be guided by an experienced team that will provide good care and support.
Are you the right candidate?

You have a master's degree in industrial sciences or computer science
Preferably, you already have at least 5 years of experience as an IT professional, although this is not a must
You have experience with or strong interest in data architecture and reporting (in SQL and PowerBI)
You have ETL experience with SSIS
You have experience with . NET development (nice to have)
Ideally experience in working with ESG data and indicators, such as carbon emissions, energy consumption, water usage, waste management, social impact, and governance practices
You are creative and able to think out-of-the-box
You are stress resistant
You are a team player
You have a healthy portion of social skills
You are fluent in Dutch and English

What do we offer you?

You can count on an attractive salary package.

In addition, you can opt for a company car or bicycle and you get 40 days of leave per year!
