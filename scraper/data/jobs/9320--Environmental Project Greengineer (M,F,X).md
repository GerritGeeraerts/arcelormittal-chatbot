Introduction
A lot is going on at ArcelorMittal Belgium concerning the climate. Various projects are ongoing or will soon be launched to ensure that our impact on the climate is as low as possible. The goal is to be carbon-neutral by 2050. The first step in our roadmap was the brand new Steelanol plant. The next step to be taken by 2030 is building a Direct Reduced Iron Plant (DRI) an Electric Arc Furnace installation to replace one of the Blast Furnaces. An EAF heats metal by means of an electric arc where a current is run through the charged metal. This will allow us to use 100% scrap metal to produce steel and reduce our CO2 emissions drastically.
