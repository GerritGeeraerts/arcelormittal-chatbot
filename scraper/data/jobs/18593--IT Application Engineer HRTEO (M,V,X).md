## Description:
Introduction
ArcelorMittal Belgium is a leading steel and mining company, with a presence in 60 countries and a workforce of over 190,000 people. We are committed to making steel more sustainable, safer and smarter, and to creating value for our stakeholders and society.
Within the ArcelorMittal Belgium IT department, we have a section called BSA (business supporting applications) that develops and maintains various applications for different business domains, such as badging (access, time & evacuation), environment, HR, safety, and others. These applications are essential for the security and well-being of our employees, contractors and visitors, as well as for the compliance and performance of our business processes.
One of the projects in scope of the function is leading the development & roll-out of our HSEQ application, which is a web-based platform that integrates health, safety, environment and quality data and processes. This project is part of our digital transformation and will help us to achieve our sustainability goals.
We are looking for an IT developer to join our BSA team and work on enhancing and revising a tool called HRTEO, which is used for team occupation and people employability. You will have the opportunity to use modern technologies (.NET Core, Angular, etc.) and to collaborate with different business units and stakeholders.
What is HRTEO and what will you do?
HRTEO is a tool that was delivered with the intention to streamline training planning and resource allocation. However, it has faced challenges in adoption and efficiency, particularly on the shop floor. The tool's current design does not conform to the industrial principles applied to other organizational tools, and it lacks the capability to add fictitious people, which is essential for planning and simulation purposes. This is key not only for HR as a process but also for all the line managers on the shop floor. Being able to better plan peoples training and new hirings should assist in keeping employees workload more manageable.
The workload will first focus on the occupation component of HRTEO, addressing both immediate enhancements and foundational improvements. The immediate enhancements include user interface improvements for quicker and more intuitive data entry, and functionality to add fictitious personnel for effective resource planning and simulation. The foundational improvements include a complete overhaul of the SSIS and stored procedures to optimize performance, and a redesign of HRTEO's architecture to align with industrial principles and integrate seamlessly with MyHR, the new Oracle training platform.
As an IT developer for HRTEO, you will be responsible for:

Designing, developing, testing and deploying applications using .NET and Angular frameworks
Ensuring the quality, performance and security of the applications
Providing support and maintenance for the existing applications
Keeping up to date with the latest technologies and best practices

You will work in a diverse team of motivated IT professionals. You will also have frequent interactions with the business users and other IT teams, to ensure alignment and integration of the applications.
Who are you?
We are looking for a candidate who has:

A bachelor’s degree in computer science or a related field
A good feeling of what HR processes entail
Strong knowledge of .NET and Angular frameworks, as well as SQL and web services
Experience with emerging technologies is a plus
Good analytical and problem-solving skills
Good communication and teamwork skills
A proactive and customer-oriented attitude
A passion for learning and innovation
A fluent level of Dutch and English

What do we offer you?
Working at ArcelorMittal means getting opportunities for a great career and the opportunity to build an international career. We give talent all the space they need to flourish with a tailor-made training program. You will join a diverse team who work day in and day out on improvements in all areas and with groundbreaking technologies.
You can count on an attractive salary package. In addition to your extremely competitive basic salary supplemented by a number of premiums, we offer you meal vouchers, an interesting group and hospitalisation insurance and other fringe benefits. In addition, you can opt for a company car or bicycle and you get 40 days of leave per year!
