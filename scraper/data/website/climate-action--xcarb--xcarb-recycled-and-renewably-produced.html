                <p>XCarb® recycled and renewably produced applies to products made via the Electric Arc Furnace route using high levels of scrap steel and 100% renewable energy. </p>
<p>By using high levels of scrap steel and renewable energy, XCarb® recycled and renewably produced products have an extremely low CO<sub>2</sub> footprint that can be as low as approximately 300kg of CO<sub>2</sub> per tonne of finished steel when the metallics are 100% scrap. </p>
<p>The electricity used in the steelmaking process is independently verified, with a ‘Guarantee of Origin’ given that it is from renewable sources. This is ensured by our purchasing of ‘Renewable Energy Certificates’ (RECs), a market-based offering that certifies the bearer owns a specific amount (in megawatt-hours) of electricity generated from a renewable energy resource. </p>
<p>This customer offer is for both flat and long products.</p>
