                <p>The United Nations 17 <a rel="noopener" href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgs" target="_blank">Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> represent the consensus reached among global leaders in 2015 on what needs to be done by 2030 to ensure peace and prosperity for people and planet. Our own <a rel="noopener" href="/sustainability/our-10-sd-outcomes/" target="_blank" title="Our 10 SD outcomes">10 SD outcomes</a> were informed by the SDGs as they were being developed in 2014. We believe our best way of contributing to the 17 SDGs is to pursue our 10 SD outcomes.  </p>
<p>Our deeper assessment of our relationship with the SDGs looks at both in our ability to contribute positive value as a business and an employer, and our potential to reduce any negative impacts we have, such as air emissions. </p>
<p>Our assessment of the SDGs, and their alignment with our 10 SD outcomes, has led us to conclude that there are four SDGs where we plan to make the most significant contributions to SD in the coming decade.</p>

<p><strong>SDG 12 Responsible production and consumption<br></strong>Working for a better world implies having open and honest conversations about our social and environmental impact on our stakeholders and the planet, and working hard to transform this into positive long-term outcomes. We have been a driving force behind the creation of <a rel="noopener" href="/sustainability/responsiblesteel/" target="_blank" title="Responsible Steel">ResponsibleSteel</a><em><a href="/sustainability/responsiblesteel/" title="Responsible Steel">™</a> ,</em> a social, environmental and governance standard created through a multi-stakeholder process. Steelmaking sites can now be audited against this standard, and customers can drive change by requiring the steel they buy is certified.</p>

        <p><strong>SDG 13 Climate Action<br></strong>we are transforming the environmental impact of steelmaking by developing breakthrough low-emissions technologies, and working with a range of partners, policymakers and thought leaders to identify and build the conditions that will enable low-emissions steelmaking to become a reality. Whilst SDG 13 is aimed at national governments, ArcelorMittal works with policymakers, as well as customers and investors and relevant initiatives such as ResponsibleSteel and the Science-based Target Initiative, to establish what mechanisms are needed to facilitate the low-emissions transition for the steel industry, in line with this target.</p>

<p><strong>SDG 17 Partnership for the goals<br></strong>Together with our collaborative approach to innovation and standard-setting, our open way of working with local communities emphasises the importance of partnership in our approach to sustainable development.
