        <h3><strong>A concept for a global low-carbon emissions steel standard</strong></h3>
<p>Today there is no industry definition or standard for low-carbon emissions steel, yet customer interest is growing, initiatives to define emissions in steel are multiplying and the risk of inconsistent standards is escalating.</p>
<p>The demand signals are clear and establishing such a standard has an important role to play in the decarbonisation of our industry. We need a low-carbon emissions steel standard which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provides transparency and consistency across products for customers through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) values, or Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) values in construction products</li>
<li>Incentivises decarbonisation by allowing policy makers to create differentiated lead markets for low-carbon emissions steel production that will provide steelmakers with a premium to fund capital investments</li>
</ul>

The carbon emissions in a tonne of steel is heavily influenced by the metallic input used in steelmaking, with secondary steelmaking (scrap-based) carrying a much lower carbon footprint than primary steelmaking (iron ore based). Although scrap steel has an important role to play in the decarbonisation of the global steel industry, it is a finite resource which is already fully utilised, and primary steel will continue to be needed to meet steel demand until well beyond 2050. Therefore, a low-carbon emissions steel standard needs to incorporate a sliding scale which accounts for the metallic input (primary/iron ore vs. secondary/scrap) of steelmaking and incentivises decarbonisation through the introduction of low-carbon emissions technology rather than simply by increasing the amount of scrap used.\u003c/p\u003e"}]},{"header":"It must include a clearly defined boundary from which carbon emissions are counted for the decarbonisation rating system","sections":[{"text":"\u003cp\u003eIt is critical that a consistent boundary is used in order to enable a like-for-like comparison between steel producers for the decarbonisation rating system, and that this boundary is representative of the core emissions of steel production. Therefore, in its initial phase our concept proposes a core steel system boundary that can be readily measured today, based on the Net-Zero Steel Pathway Methodology Project, which counts all Scope 1 and 2 emissions as well as selected Scope 3 emissions from ironmaking, steelmaking, casting and rolling. As measuring methodology and primary upstream emissions data becomes available this boundary would then be extended in a second phase to include upstream emissions.\u003c/p\u003e"}]}]}'></accordion>

                <h3>The decarbonisation rating system</h3>
<p>The graph below demonstrates the concept of how the decarbonisation rating system would work</p>
<p>A steel producer’s position on the graph would be based on their embodied carbon emissions per tonne of hot rolled steel (y-axis) and the metallic input they use (x-axis). The producer’s position would fall above or below a threshold line, indicating whether they would be producing low-carbon emissions steel or not.</p>
<p>Furthermore, steel producers which fall on or below the threshold would then be split into six bands - A<sup>+</sup> to E - with the producer progressing through the bands as they decarbonise. This system could therefore be used by policy makers and customers to incentivise producers to further decarbonise in order to attain a higher rating (with A and A<sup>+</sup> being the highest and the only category where producers could claim their steel to be near zero (A) or net zero (A<sup>+</sup>)). </p>

        <p class="rte ">“We know that our customers want low-carbon steel products. That is why we launched the XCarb™ green steel certificates which have proved very popular with our customers. However, these are virtual low-carbon products and we must also have a system that defines what constitutes physical low-carbon steel during the transition to near and ultimately net zero. This will help support a return on the investment required to transition to low-carbon steelmaking which will be more costly than the technologies used today. We believe it is important that any standard has a dual approach that clearly states the LCA value of the product as well as a rating to show decarbonisation progress. This makes the embodied carbon content of the product clear to customers but also the progress that producer is making towards near zero – a vital component of ensuring every company contributes to achieving the Paris Agreement.”
