                <h2 style="text-align: left;">Our approach</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Focus on iron ore reduction:</strong> Iron ore reduction is where the vast majority of carbon emissions come from in steelmaking. Steel can also be made from scrap, but the global amount that can be produced, whilst much lower in emissions, is limited by the availability of end-of-life steel. Currently supplies are only enough to support one third of steel production globally.  By 2050 end-of-life scrap will still only contribute under half of global steel demand, so the world will continue to rely on iron ore until around 2100.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The carbon challenge for the industry in the coming decades must therefore be to transform the way in which we turn iron ore into steel. This is where our focus lies when it comes to reducing our carbon footprint.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">We generate renewable energy onsite in Ghent, Belgium, with 10 wind turbines and a 9.7MW solar roof, and further installations at our Bremen and Hamburg plants in Germany, and Fos-sur-Mer in France. We are actively exploring the potential for power purchase agreements to supply our electric arc furnace steel plants with renewable energy wherever prices are competitive.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In 2018, we concluded an agreement to purchase electricity from two solar farms in Spain expected to generate 8.6GWh annually. In Ghent, Belgium, we installed the country's target solar roof in 2019, with a 10MW capacity. This is part of the plan to install 50MW of solar and wind capacity by the end of 2020.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As renewables increasingly become part of electricity grids, balancing generation and consumption is key. At our Hamburg site, a “time shift” process regulates the power consumption of the electric arc furnace to absorb surplus electricity from nearby wind power generation.</p>
