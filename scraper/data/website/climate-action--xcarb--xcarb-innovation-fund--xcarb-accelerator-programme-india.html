                <p><span class="orange"><strong>Are you a start up with big plans to reduce emissions?</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="orange"><strong>Are you looking to make a meaningful impact to accelerate decarbonisation in the steel industry?</strong></span></p>
<p><span class="orange"><strong>Do you want to establish your technologies as market leading and become recognised for your help towards the transition to low, and ultimately zero, carbon emissions steelmaking?</strong></span></p>
<p>At ArcelorMittal, we are focused on reducing our CO2e emissions intensity by 35% in Europe and by 25% globally by 2030. Key to achieving this will be innovation and technological shifts. We launched the XCarb™ Innovation Fund in 2021 to invest in companies developing technologies that hold the potential to accelerate the steel industry’s transition to carbon neutral steelmaking.</p>
<p>The Fund's Accelerator Programme supports entrepreneurs and start-ups in this space - the aim is to find the best and brightest ideas from across the world. The inaugural Accelerator Programme launched globally in 2022 with CHAR Technologies, a cleantech company developing high temperature pyrolysis technology that transforms organic waste streams into valuable energy outputs, announced as the winner.</p>
<p><strong><span class="orange">The XCarb™ India Accelerator Programme</span></strong></p>
<p>In recognition of India’s ambition, capabilities, and unique challenges in supporting the global energy transition we have launched a new, dedicated XCarb™ Accelerator Programme targeted at the country’s deep ecosystem of technology start-ups. Applications for the current XCarb™ India Accelerator Programme are now closed. </p>

        <p class="rte ">“Prioritising the reduction of carbon intensity in our steel production remains at the core of our long-term strategy. Our XCarb™ Innovation Fund exists to find the most exciting global ventures focused on steel decarbonisation and India’s record as a technology leader, combined with its efforts to become a climate leader, makes it a natural destination for the fund’s second Accelerator Programme. I am confident that our collaboration with IIT Madras, an institution that epitomises India’s tech prowess, will nurture start-ups and help to provide further impetus to ArcelorMittal and AM/NS India’s decarbonisation initiatives.” Aditya Mittal, CEO of ArcelorMittal and Chairman of AM/NS India</p>
