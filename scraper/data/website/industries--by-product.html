                <h3>When we make steel, we also create by-products. The vast majority are either fed back into the steelmaking process to make it more efficient, or sold for use in a surprising variety of applications, from making roads to fertilising crops. Overall, the steel industry achieves a material efficiency rate of 97.6% and is moving towards a goal of 100% efficiency and zero waste.</h3>
<p>The main by-products from the steelmaking process are slag, process gases, and dusts and sludges. The coking process also produces a range of chemicals such as ammonia, sulphur and naptha that are all sold commercially. We operate a hierarchy for managing steelmaking residues that works towards our goal of zero non-hazardous waste to landfill.</p>
