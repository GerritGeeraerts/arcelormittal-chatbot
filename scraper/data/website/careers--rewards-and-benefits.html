<h3>Acknowledged as the world’s leading steel company, ArcelorMittal offers all employees competitive renumeration packages. These typically include salary at fair industry rates, holiday pay, contribution by the company to pension savings, performance-related bonus schemes to incentivize high levels of achievement and other benefits. But rewards and benefits at ArcelorMittal go further than that. Much further.</h3>
<p>We are the most international of all steel manufacturing companies, with a presence in 60 countries and primary steelmaking facilities in 16 countries. So for those keen to experience life abroad, we encourage mobility by offering overseas positions to help individuals broaden their personal and professional horizons. We have a specialised division dedicated to such opportunities, and to ensuring that the overseas adventure runs smoothly.</p>
<p>The company offers a wide range of health and wellness benefits including, typically, medical insurance cover, travel insurance, paid maternity and paternity leave and a range of self-help programmes.</p>
<p>But perhaps one of the most important benefits is the motivation and personal engagement that employees feel by being part of a company that, through its products, enables so much of what we take for granted in modern life today. The fact is that so much of our modern world – things like cars, tall buildings, bridges, home appliances, wind turbines and railways are made of steel. And that many things that surround us that are not made of steel – such as fabrics, glass and plastics – are made using machines that <strong><em>are</em></strong> made of steel.</p>
