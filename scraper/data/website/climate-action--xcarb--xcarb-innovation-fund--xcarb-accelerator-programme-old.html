                <p><strong>Are you a start up with big plans to reduce emissions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Are you looking to make a meaningful impact to accelerate decarbonisation in the steel industry?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you want to establish your technologies as market leading and become recognised for your help towards the transition to low, and ultimately zero, carbon emissions steelmaking?</strong></p>
<p>On 25th May 2022, we launched our XCarb™ Accelerator Programme, which will give you the opportunity to pitch your ideas at our Accelerator Day in July for the chance to secure not only investment support from our XCarb™ Innovation Fund, but also gain access to our company’s invaluable industry, R&amp;D and commercial expertise.</p>
<p>At ArcelorMittal, we are focused on reducing our CO2e emissions intensity by 35% in Europe and by 25% globally by 2030. Key to achieving this will be innovation and technological shifts which is why we are supporting entrepreneurs and start-ups in this space - we are looking for the best and brightest ideas from across the world.</p>
