                <p>ArcelorMittal has adopted a data protection procedure (“Binding Corporate Rules”). This procedure provides a global and simplified legal basis for all databases and applications sharing personal data within the group. The ArcelorMittal data protection procedure is a group-wide procedure ensuring a minimum standard of protection for personal data shared at global level, similar to the protection offered under EU rules.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use personal data obtained through this Web Site (<a rel="noopener" href="http://corporate.arcelormittal.com/" target="_blank">corporate.arcelormittal.com</a>).

Please review the Policy or Privacy Statement for any information that applies specifically to that particular form.</p>
