<p style="text-align: left;">Promoting good health is not only the right thing to do, we depend on it to maintain a productive and positive workplace. As well as eliminating accidents, our Journey to Zero also aims to bring occupational diseases down to zero. It's also about encouraging healthy lifestyles and fostering well-being, both at work and at home. Understanding what impacts our employee’s health, how their health is affected and how to mitigate risks is not an easy task. All which comprise the safety culture we have molded over the years.</p>

                <h2 style="text-align: left;">Our approach</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">We actively promote good health – first, because it's the right thing to do, and second, because it helps maintain a productive and positive workplace. As well as eliminating accidents, our Journey to Zero also aims to bring occupational diseases down to zero. It's also about encouraging healthy lifestyles and fostering wellbeing, both at work and at home. Some issues are common to almost all our sites – like the problems that can be caused by smoking, and drug and alcohol abuse – while others are specific to particular regions, such as Ebola in West Africa, or the zika virus in Brazil. This is why health and wellness are managed at a local level, while supported by group-wide standards and policies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We're encouraging projects to capture and share best operational practices across regions – helping us to raise our standards and to go above and beyond what local regulation requires. This is part of creating a culture where employees at all levels work with a constant awareness of and respect for responsible working practices. We're also members of the International Occupational Hygiene Association and have a network of occupational health and hygiene professionals. We regularly discuss occupational health and wellbeing issues with our Joint Health and Safety Working Committee.</p>
