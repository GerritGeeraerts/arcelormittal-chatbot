                <p><strong>Accessibility statement</strong></p>
<p>The ArcelorMittal website is designed to be as accessible as possible. Web accessibility aims to remove barriers that prevent interaction with (or access to) websites by people with disabilities including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity and combinations of these. Good accessibility also makes web content more usable for all users.</p>
<p>In designing the user experience of for site we have been guided the four principles of the W3Câ€™s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Perceivable</strong>: We offer text alternatives for some non-text content and create content so it can be presented more simply if needed, without losing information or structure.</li>
<li><strong>Operable</strong>. People can use our site with a keyboard and we make it easy for them to navigate, find content and work out where they are.</li>
<li><strong>Understandable</strong>. We ensure that text content is easy to read and that web pages work predictably.</li>
<li><strong>Robust</strong>. We aim for maximum compatibility with user agents (e.g. web browsers), including assistive technologies.</li>
</ol>
<p><br>Note</p>
<p>Our accessibility initiatives are driven by user needs rather than legislation. In the US, there are no requirements for non-government websites such as the ArcelorMittal web estate to be WCAG or ADA (Americans with Disability Act) compliant. Elsewhere, other countries have disability discrimination laws that cover websites, but these do not specify the technical standards required to comply with the law.</p>
