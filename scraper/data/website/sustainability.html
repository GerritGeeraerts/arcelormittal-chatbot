                <p>Steel has been central to human progress. And steel will continue to be inherently useful because it is strong, durable, flexible and reusable, and is the most easily recycled material - perfect for a circular economy. But it is essential that the next chapter in our story does not compromise future generations. Steel needs to evolve to become smarter and more sustainable.</p>
<p>This means preparing for and responding to the most significant long-term environmental and social trends that are transforming the context in which we operate. This means listening carefully to stakeholders, both locally and globally, and recognising a trend of rising expectations. This means outlining what we need to do now to protect and grow value for stakeholders in the future. This means continuing to produce innovative steel products and solutions while maintaining operational standards that meet and exceed the expectations of customers and investors.</p>
<p>The integration of sustainable development into the business is essential in ensuring steel is the material of choice in the transition toward a circular and low-carbon economy.</p>
