                <h2 style="text-align: left;">Our Approach</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Building a pipeline of talented scientists and engineers is therefore an important theme of our sustainable development strategy. We know that people with STEM skills will play a critical part in building a sustainable future for society at large, for the steel industry and for our business.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We have a global network of STEM champions who share good practices and ideas on a quarterly basis.  These initiatives span a variety of areas, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Partnerships with universities and technical colleges, such as Brown University and MIT in the US, Cambridge in the UK, Lausanne in Switzerland, McMasters in Canada, and the China Central University, led by our 12 R&amp;D centres.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Hosting engineering students on long-term internships. Across Global R&amp;D, we host nearly 100 MSc students and some 40 PhD students.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Providing in-class support for primary and secondary-level children in many countries.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Award schemes for students, such as the Prix des Innovateurs dedicated to the future of the industrial sector in France; the Environment Award in Brazil for elementary school students; and the ArcelorMittal Advanced Academic Scholarship Program (AAASP) in Liberia.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Science camps and education centres, for example our Science Centre programmes in South Africa, Kinder Camps and Mighty Acorns® Nature Camps in Indiana, USA.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Employee volunteering to deliver workshops and research projects with students.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Hackathons, such as ‘The Challenge’, jointly organised with Microsoft in Belgium, calling for creative solutions to an industry-based problem within 48 hours; and an artificial intelligence hackathon in Montreal, Canada.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Partnerships with global brands such as Lego, to encourage young people to enjoy developing their STEM skills.</li>
