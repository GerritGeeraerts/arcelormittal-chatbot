This could be a credible certification scheme like ResponsibleSteel™, with robust requirements for both the steelmaker and the steel product to be aligned with the goals of the Paris agreement. The more steel customers requiring the use of this market tool, the more demand will drive the alignment – and progress - of the industry to achieving Paris.  </li>

<li><strong>Access to sufficient and affordable clean energy</strong>. The shift away from fossil fuels will need very large amounts of clean energy. Policies enabling the steel industry to access large-scale sources of renewable electricity at affordable prices will be key to scaling up steelmaking using green hydrogen or electrolysis. <br>To accelerate the circular carbon pathway, the steel industry needs priority access to biomass and waste. Where public policy, for example, may currently allocate biomass to power stations, where it is used only once, if it were used in steel plants, the carbon it contains could be captured and reused, turning this limited source of energy into a circular resource that will be used and recycled repeatedly. </li>
