                <h3>We have 24 tailings storage facilities (TSFs), including dry stack and in-pit disposal, with 19 facilities in active use and five dormant.</h3>
<p>Our governance model is based on MAC (Mining Association of Canada) guidelines. Globally, our tailings stewardship programme uses three types of audits, in addition to the local Engineer of Record – in-house at site level, in-house at corporate level, and a third, independent audit which are benchmarked against international guidelines of the Australian Committee on Large Dams (<a href="https://www.ancold.org.au/">ANCOLD</a>), <a href="https://mining.ca/towards-sustainable-mining/protocols-frameworks/tailings-management-protocol/">MAC</a>, and the Canadian Dam Association (<a href="https://www.cda.ca/">CDA</a>).</p>
<p>The Company is working on the potential application of non-wet or reduced moisture tailings disposal methodologies such as thickened, paste, dry stack and in-pit tailings options where appropriate. This approach is already in use in Mexico, Brazil and Quebec iron ore mines.</p>
