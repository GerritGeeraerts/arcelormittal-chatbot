                <p>In February 2022 we announced a €1.7 billion investment in the decarbonisation of our French operations. This project will transform our two primary steelmaking sites in France, Dunkirk and Fos-sur-Mer, enabling a reduction in CO2 emissions of almost <strong>40%</strong> or <strong>7.8 million tonnes</strong> per year by 2030. The French government has supported this investment at a level which guarantees the viability of the project.</p>
<p>The plan involves the construction of a 2.5 million tonnes-a-year direct reduced iron furnace and two electric furnaces at ArcelorMittal Dunkirk, and an electric furnace at ArcelorMittal Fos-sur-Mer. The new installations are expected to be operational in 2027, when two blast furnaces in Dunkirk and one in Fos-sur-Mer will gradually be phased out. Once this transition is complete by 2030, ArcelorMittal France’s CO2 emissions would reduce by almost 40% compared with 2018, equivalent to the CO2 emissions from a car being driven around the earth almost 800,000 times<a name="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1"><span>[1]</span></a>.</p>

        <p class="rte "> “As a leader in steelmaking, ArcelorMittal is committed to decarbonising its plants in Europe to serve our industrial customers – automotive, packaging, construction, transport but also solar and wind energy and future networks for hydrogen and CO2 capture. We are grateful for this support from the French State which will enable the major transformation of our sites in Fos-sur-Mer and Dunkirk which together account for over one-third of ArcelorMittal’s flat steel production in Europe.” Yves Koeberlé, CEO of ArcelorMittal Europe – Flat Products</p>
