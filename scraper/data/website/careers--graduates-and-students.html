                <h3>ArcelorMittal’s global scale and scope means that our graduate and student offer is correspondingly wide. We are always looking for motivated and skilled people who want to have a role in making the world around them, and who are willing to take the initiative to make that happen.</h3>
<p>With positions around the world – and in different areas of the business – we provide a wide range of opportunities for university graduates looking to work in a challenging environment. We look for students who are motivated, enthusiastic and who want to experience the real world of work. Working at ArcelorMittal provides students with a place to develop and apply their education in practice. To ensure we attract top talent, we partner with universities and schools through sponsorship, job fairs, scholarships and educational activities.</p>
<p>Our involvement in the volunteer for international experience scheme (VIE) offers European graduates the chance to work overseas at our sites. We believe the VIE programme is a real opportunity to experience working life at ArcelorMittal in an international context, helping us to build the workforce of our future.</p>
