        <p><strong>A word from Stephanie Werner-Dietz, Group Head of Human Resources</strong></p>
<p>“Continuing to build an inclusive and diverse workplace is a key pillar of our new people strategy and a primary area of focus for 2023. I believe that inclusion and diversity provides our organisation with many benefits, including better talent access and higher engagement and trust levels, which ultimately leads to better outcomes and improved performance. There is still much to be done, but we are making progress. In 2021 we formed a group diversity and inclusion (D&amp;I) council to govern and champion D&amp;I globally. In particular, we are focused on improving our gender diversity and have committed to doubling the overall representation of women in management to reach at least 25% by 2030.  This film celebrates the progress we’ve made on our journey to make ArcelorMittal a truly inclusive and diverse organisation where everyone feels welcome, respected and appreciated.”</p>
