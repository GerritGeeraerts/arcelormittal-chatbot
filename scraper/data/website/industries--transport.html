                <h3><strong>Automotive</strong></h3>
<p>We’re a technology leader in advanced steels for the automotive industry. Visit our <a href="/industries/automotive-and-mobility/" title="Automotive and mobility">automotive</a> page to discover more about what we’re doing to make cars, vans and trucks lighter and stronger.</p>
<h3><strong>Maritime</strong></h3>
<p>Our steel products are used to build all varieties of ships, including general cargo carriers, container ships, cruise ships and large tankers that carry liquefied natural gas (LNG). We also make sheet piles – columns of steel driven into the ground to support a structure – used in the construction of ports and harbours.</p>
<h3><strong>Rail</strong></h3>
<p>In the rail industry, we make steel products for both railway tracks and trains. One of our most extensive projects is to supply rails for the Spanish high-speed network, which is currently being expanded to 10,000km by 2020. Our steel mill in Gijón, Spain, with technology to roll rails up to 90m long, has rolled almost every rail for this project.</p>
<p>Our steel is also used in rolling stock for the rail industry, for example, we have developed new, lighter steel solutions for freight wagons. We created an ultra-high-strength steel (UHSS) solution that reduces the weight of an empty freight wagon by 33% and material costs by 34%. These wagons are lighter, produce fewer emissions in use and require less steel, which reduces emissions from production as well as transport.</p>
<p>ArcelorMittal also makes compact monowire technology, which has been used for more than 1,500 ropes for cableways in different parts of the world.</p>
